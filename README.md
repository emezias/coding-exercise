# Show us your code

If you have existing code that you can share with us and are proud of, these exercises are optional—just send us a link to the repository (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.).

## RelayRides Code Exercises

If you are doing an exercise, you can pick any of the ones below.

### Mobile or Desktop Client (Front-end)

Please do not hesitate to share any mobile portfolio apps that make you proud along with an app that meets the requirements of the challenge. Make it fast with a fast network!  

#### Create an Android app with the Hotwire API
The requirements are the same as Search, listed below. The programming language should be java with standard Android xml layouts. Send us an apk that runs on Android 4 and 5 along with a link to your repository. You can use any libraries and tools you like. Volley and Glide libraries are not required but recommended. 

#### Create an iOS app with the Hotwire API
The requirements are the same as Search, done with Swift, Objective-C or any combination of those. You can use any libraries and tools you like. We will be looking for a user experience consistent with Apple's guidelines. 
Send us a link to the repo and an IPA file to test out your code.

#### Search

Build a single-page rental car search app using [Hotwire’s Shopping API][hotwire]. It requires registering for an API key, but it should only take 60 seconds to register your test application.

At a minimum, the user should be able to:

- search by date and location
- view results in a list
- click on a result to view more details about the car

We’ll be looking for clean, well-structured code and a polished user interface.

##### Android

###### iOS

##### Web

The choice of technologies (Angular, React, LESS, etc.) are up to you, but all projects should have a single `index.html` that loads scripts and stylesheets. Send us a link to your repository, as well as a hosted (Heroku, Google App Engine, Amazon EC2, etc.) version.

### Server (Back-end)

#### Simple Database

We really like [Thumbtack’s Simple Database Challenge][sdb]. We couldn’t put it better than they did, so just follow their instructions and send us a link to your repository.

### Acknowledgements

In addition to Thumbtack, we have taken a decent helping of inspiration from [Uber’s coding challenge][uber].
